# espresso-py

Educational Python reimplementation of the Espresso two-level Boolean logic minimizer.

## Goals
- Implement core Espresso loop: expand → reduce → irredundant
- Focus on clarity and correctness, not performance
- Support small `.pla` inputs

## Status
Work in progress.

## Credits
Based on the original C implementation of Espresso from UC Berkeley.
